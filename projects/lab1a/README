Design Decisions & Issues
-------------------------

The implementation does not set up a signal handler for the ^C and instead treats ^C as a character just like <cr>. When the ^C character is encountered by checking the character read, the kill() function is called to the sending the SIGINT signal to the shell process.

The implementation does not show the exit status for the EOF from shell exit.

The parent's thread is the thread which reads input from the keyboard, echoes it to stdout, and forwards it to the shell.
