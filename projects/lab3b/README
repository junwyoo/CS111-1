make 
	- runs command 'python lab3b.py > lab3b_check.txt' which creates lab3b_check.txt with ordering issues

make check
	- sorts the lab3b_check.txt file with default flags and writes to same file
	- creates a file 'sorted_correct.txt' which is the lab3b_correct.txt file sorted with default flags and checks both with diff

make dist 
	- makes tarball

make clean
	- removes sorted_correct.txt and lab3b_check.txt
