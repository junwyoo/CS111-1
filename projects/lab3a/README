	lab3a.c - implementation for lab3a

	README	- what you're reading

	disk-image - disk provided from spec

	Makefile
		- makefile containing commands as follows

			make - builds the target ./lab3a
			make run - runs the program with "./lab3a disk-image" and generates csv files
			make check - runs diff commands on csv files generated vs provided
			make dist - makes tarball
			make clean - removes program and csv files and restores to original state

============================

Note:

	The bitmap.csv file when first created is not sorted and thus must be sorted.

	The 'make check' command creates a sorted_bitmap.csv file in current directory that is sorted numerically (since sort doesn't offer a hexadecimal sort) of the provided file and compares it to the generated bitmap.csv file after it is sorted in place.
